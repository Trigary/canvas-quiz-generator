## Task description

This is an example quiz description.

- Markdown files are automatically converted to HTML, but this requires `pandoc` to be installed.
- `.txt` files also get converted to HTML: their newlines are replaced with `<br>`.
- Placeholders are supported. For example, [[FRUIT]] is a fruit specified in the JSON config.

Run the application via: `python3 example.py --student-key [[STUDENT_KEY]]`

```bash
# This is a verbatim block
echo It was tricky to get this to work in .md files
```
